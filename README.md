Our project is a reproducible work on the original paper '[BEHRT: Transformer for Electronic Health Records](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62922-y)' 

The main task is to predict the multilabel of disease diagnosis of next visit given a patient's past visits on the MIMIC-III.

We perform the following tasks and an ablation study to understand feature importance.
  - pre-trained masked language model for input features embedding 
  - downstream multilabel prediction of diagnosis code
